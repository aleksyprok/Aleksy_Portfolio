# About me <a name="about_me"></a>

**Hi, I'm Aleksy. A solar physicist. I use computer simulations to model magntohydrodynamic (MHD) waves in the solar atmosphere.** I am a PhD student working with the [Solar and Magnetospheric Theory Group](http://www-solar.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/) in the [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/mathematics-statistics/) at the [University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/), Scotland. 

My research interests include:
* Coronal [MHD waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetohydrodynamics#Waves), where the corona refers to the outer layer of the solar atmosphere, see Figure X.
* [Coronal seismology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_seismology). This is a process where hard to measure quantities such as the magnetic field strength and the plasma density can be inferred from easier to measure quantities using MHD wave theory.
* [Coronal heating problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_corona#Coronal_heating_problem). This problem relates to the question; "Why does the corona have a temperature of 10<sup>6</sup>&thinsp;K while the photosphere which is closer to the centre of the Sun has a temperture of about 6000&thinsp;K?"
* Designing code to solve the MHD equations using [finite difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference), [finite volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_volume_method), [spectral method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_method) and [method of lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_lines) techniques.
