# About me <a name="about_me"></a>

**Hi, I'm Alex. A solar physicist. I use computer simulations to model magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves in the Sun's atmosphere. More recently, I have been developing codes to extrapolate the coronal magnetic field from observed solar magnetograms.** I am a research fellow working with the [Solar and Magnetospheric Theory Group](http://www-solar.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/) in the [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/mathematics-statistics/) at the [University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/), Scotland. 

My research interests include:
* Extrapolating the Sun's magnetic field based on [magnetograms](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/).
* Coronal [MHD waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetohydrodynamics#Waves), where the corona refers to the outer layer of the solar atmosphere (see Figure 1).
* [Coronal seismology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_seismology). This is a process where hard to measure quantities (e.g. magnetic field strength and plasma density) can be inferred from easier to measure quantities (e.g. wave period and damping time) using MHD wave theory.
* [Coronal heating problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_corona#Coronal_heating_problem). This problem relates to the question; "Why does the corona have a temperature of 10<sup>6</sup>&thinsp;K while the photosphere, which is closer to the centre of the Sun has a temperature of about 6000&thinsp;K?"
* Designing code to solve the MHD equations using [finite difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference), [finite volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_volume_method), [spectral method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_method) and [method of lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_lines) techniques.

**Fig. 1** This photo was taken from [Wikimedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Solar_eclipse_1999_4_NR.jpg). It was taken in France during the 1999 solar eclipse. It shows the solar atmosphere. The chromosphere radiates a pink light. The corona is visible here due to it scattering white light from the photosphere. |  **Fig. 2** Picture of me at the St Andrew's pier. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

# Teaching <a name="teaching"></a>

Each semester of my PhD, I have assisted with the teaching in the maths department at St Andrews. My teaching has mainly involved supervising computer workshops. This is where the students are given computer assignments to work on, e.g. create a program to output the first n Pythagorean triples. My job is to answer questions and deal with any computer-related issues the students have. I have also taught tutorial classes, and this is where we discuss a problem sheet with a class of 10 students.

The classes I have taught are:
* September-December 2017, Computing in mathematics, Fortran 90 computer class
* January-April 2018, Vector calculus, tutorial class
* September-December 2018, Multivariate calculus, Python computer class
* January-April 2019, Mathematics, Maple computer class
* January-April 2019, Mathematical modelling, Python computer class
* September-December 2019, Computing in mathematics, Fortran 90 computer class
* January-April 2020, Pure and applied mathematics, Maple computer class
* September-December 2020, Multivariate calculus, Python computer class
