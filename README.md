# About me

**Hi, I'm Alex Prokopyszyn. A solar physicist. I use computer simulations to model magntohydrodynamic (MHD) waves in the solar atmosphere.** I am a PhD student working in the [Solar and Magnetospheric Theory Group](http://www-solar.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/) in the [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/mathematics-statistics/) at the [University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/), Scotland. Here are links to my LinkedIn, Stack Exchange, GitHub and Google Scholar accounts.
