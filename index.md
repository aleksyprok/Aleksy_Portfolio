<!-- ## About me <a name="about_me"></a>

**Hi, I'm Alex. A solar physicist. I use computer simulations to model magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves in the Sun's atmosphere. More recently, I have been developing codes to extrapolate the coronal magnetic field from observed [solar magnetograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetogram).** I am a research fellow working with the [Solar and Magnetospheric Theory Group](http://www-solar.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/) in the [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/mathematics-statistics/) at the [University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/), Scotland. 

My research interests include:
* Extrapolating the Sun's magnetic field based on [magnetograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetogram).
* Coronal [MHD waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetohydrodynamics#Waves), where the corona refers to the outer layer of the solar atmosphere (see Figure 1).
* [Coronal seismology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_seismology). This is a process where hard to measure quantities (e.g. magnetic field strength and plasma density) can be inferred from easier to measure quantities (e.g. wave period and damping time) using MHD wave theory.
* [Coronal heating problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_corona#Coronal_heating_problem). This problem relates to the question; "Why does the corona have a temperature of 10<sup>6</sup>&thinsp;K while the photosphere, which is closer to the centre of the Sun has a temperature of about 6000&thinsp;K?"
* Designing code to solve the MHD equations using [finite difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference), [finite volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_volu
method), [spectral method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_method) and [method of lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_lines) techniques. -->

**Hi, I'm Alex. A plasma physicist. I use computer simulations to model plasma inside of [tokamaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokamak).** I work for the the [UK Atomic Energy Authority](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-atomic-energy-authority) at the [Culham Centre for Fusion Energy](https://ccfe.ukaea.uk/) in Oxfordshire. I am currently helping to design a fusion reactor called the [Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production](https://ccfe.ukaea.uk/research/step/#:~:text=The%20Spherical%20Tokamak%20for%20Energy%20Production%20%28STEP%29%20is,which%20has%20been%20under%20development%20since%20the%201980s.) which is a UK based nuclear fusion power plant which we aim to build by 2040.

My research interests include:
* GPU programming, specifically [CUDA Fortran](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-fortran).
* Modelling fast ions inside tokamaks.
* Estimating heat loads on tokamak walls using [kernel density estimates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation) and other advanced statistical techniques.
* Extrapolating the Sun's magnetic field based on [magnetograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetogram).
* Coronal [MHD waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetohydrodynamics#Waves), where the corona refers to the outer layer of the solar atmosphere (see Figure 1).

## Work/Research experience  <a name="research_experience"></a>

### Culham Centre for Fusion Energy, Fast Particle Modeller
September 2021 - Present

*	Helping to design a nuclear fusion reactor called [STEP (Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production)](https://ccfe.ukaea.uk/research/step/#:~:text=The%20Spherical%20Tokamak%20for%20Energy%20Production%20%28STEP%29%20is,which%20has%20been%20under%20development%20since%20the%201980s.), where the goal is to build a Nuclear Reactor which puts clean energy onto the national grid by 2040.
*	Using and developing a [CUDA-Fortan](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-fortran) monte-carlo code called the [Lorentz Orbit Code for Use in Stellerators and Tokamaks (LOCUST)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-4326/ac108c/meta) to model particles in the reactor.
*	Implementing advanced statistical techniques to improve the accuracy of the code. For example, implementing a [KDE (Kernel Density Estimate)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_kernel_density_estimation#:~:text=Kernel%20density%20estimation%20is%20a%20nonparametric%20technique%20for,introduced%20in%20the%20scientific%20literature%20for%20univariate%20da) method with a [leave-one-out cross-validation bandwidth selector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)#Leave-one-out_cross-validation), to estimate the heat load distribution for the fast particles hitting hte walls of the reactor.


### University of St Andrews, Research fellow
March  2021 – September 2021

I helped develop a Fortran code called [Hexa](https://github.com/aleksyprok/Hexa_apkp) to extrapolate the [solar coronal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_corona) magnetic field from [magnetograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_magnetogram). I imporved the accuracy of the code by allowing it fully utilise more data provided by the magnetograms. I helped imprve the efficency of the code by helping to parallelise it using [MPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface). 


### University of St Andrews, PhD Mathematics
September 2017 – March 2021 (passed viva 2nd June 2021)

My PhD used computer simulations to model MHD waves in the solar corona, working with Prof Alan Hood, Prof Ineke De Moortel, Dr Andrew Wright and funded by STFC. The areas I worked in were:
*	Developing and exploiting a Fortran 90 code called [LaRe2D](https://github.com/Warwick-Plasma) to model plasma in the solar atmosphere. Researchers have been developing the code across several universities since 2001. I used a supercomputer at the university to run my simulations and analysed the data using python and IDL. The work involved bug fixing and simulating nonlinear waves which led to [my first published paper](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2019/04/aa34939-18/aa34939-18.html).
* Using analytical techniques to rule out a proposed coronal heating mechanism called phase mixing. This work led to my [second published paper](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2019/12/aa36658-19/aa36658-19.html).
*	Creating my own 3D codes to model resonant absorption. [The first code](https://github.com/aleksyprok/leapfrog_code) used a finite-difference technique. To improve the computational efficiency, I developed a [new code](https://github.com/aleksyprok/apkp_thesis/tree/main/Python/Chapter4/spectral_code) that uses a combination of finite-difference, spectral method, and method of line techniques. This work led to my [third paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10497), which is currently in preparation for publication.

## Teaching <a name="teaching"></a>

Each semester of my PhD, I have assisted with the teaching in the maths department at St Andrews. My teaching has mainly involved supervising computer workshops. This is where the students are given computer assignments to work on, e.g. create a program to output the first n Pythagorean triples. My job is to answer questions and deal with any computer-related issues the students have. I have also taught tutorial classes, and this is where we discuss a problem sheet with a class of 10 students.

The classes I have taught are:
* September-December 2017, Computing in mathematics, Fortran 90 computer class
* January-April 2018, Vector calculus, tutorial class
* September-December 2018, Multivariate calculus, Python computer class
* January-April 2019, Mathematics, Maple computer class
* January-April 2019, Mathematical modelling, Python computer class
* September-December 2019, Computing in mathematics, Fortran 90 computer class
